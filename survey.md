# Survey on Rhetorical Figures
In this survey, we investigated over 40 papers that computationally detect lesser-known rhetorical figures beyond metaphor, irony, and sarcasm. During the research, we created a file containing all approaches with their details on models, language, performance scores, and many more.

The table is additional material to the paper titled: 
**"Computational Approaches to the Detection of Lesser-Known Rhetorical Figures: A Systematic Survey and Research Challenges"**  with the authors **Ramona Kühn, Jelena Mitrović, and Michael Granitzer.**
