# Survey of the Computational Detection of Lesser-Known Rhetorical Figures
In this survey, we investigated 24 different, lesser-known rhetorical figures and approaches to computationally detect them. During the research, we created a file containing all approaches with their details on models, language, performance scores, and many more.
